# Exploring Covid-19 with data


This contains a Jupyter Notebook, chart images and some CSV data files used in the analysis.

The aim was to explore the impact of Covid-19 on various countries around the world both in terms of cases and deaths as well as in terms of economic impact 
(as measured by GDP shrinkage from Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019).

The notebook also investigates the impact lockdowns in the UK had on rising death rates, how Sweden compared to its neighbours, which countries were affected the 
most and which countries did the most testing.

The blog post [here](https://lee-hodg.github.io/blog/covid-analysis/) contains a write up of the findings.
